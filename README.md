2020 NFL Draft Rankings for Each Team

Scraped data from numerous websites that ranked the 2020 NFL Draft for each team. 
Sites include: 

  - SportingNews (writer: Vinnie Iyer)
  - ProFootballFocus (PFF) (writer: Staff)
  - WalterFootball (writer: Staff)
  - NFL.COM (writer: Chad Reuter)
  - SportsIllustrated (writer: Andy Benoit)
  - CBS Sports (writer: Ryan Wilson)
  - Yahoo (writer: Eric Edholm)
  - SBNation (writer: Dan Kadar)
  - DRAFTWIRE (writer: Luke Easterling)

Quantified the grades based on a standard 4.0 scale. There are a few A+s in these rankings, however, they are listed as the same as an A (4.0).

Used these grading scales to create two tables. One of these tables uses a color map to visualize the grading.
Other table is an HTML table that uses the logos of the NFL teams. Logos are from http://loodibee.com.
